# GraphDB
Building graph database of IZTECH's fall semester for weekly schedule.
What I want to do in this project is to create a database for the fall semester of the university. For this, I first collected my data, 
then I started to create my graph database via neo4j. I have defined constraints to prevent duplicated data. In order to ensure the 
singularity of the relationships I have created, I have defined them as unique. Finally, I wrote a few queries to test the functionality
of the database I created.
